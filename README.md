## Canadian D4D Projects:

**Slack:** [#country-canada](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/country-canada/)

**Project Description:**
This repository is for D4D projects relating to Canada. Currently there is some interest shown for working on a
Canada-Dashboard similar to the USA-Dashboard project and looking into the [MyDemocracy.ca](https://www.mydemocracy.ca/) survey results.

Anyone interested in any other projects is welcome to discuss on [#country-canada](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/country-canada/)

**Project Lead:**
 * @burrbank
  (hoping to get another 1-2 people)
 
* canada-dashboard

    * TBD

**Maintainers (people with write access):**


**Data:** 

General purpose data sets will currently go to the /data folder as datasets get added to the project. Data specific to a project should be added to that project's data file (eventually migrating over to data.world).
